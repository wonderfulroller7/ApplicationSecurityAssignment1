To build a spell checker
------------------------

The spell checker should be able to differentiate between singles and plurals.

Adding GPG key to my account.

- Part 1:
	- Create GPG key to make sure that all our commits can be verified.
	- Make sure that Travis correctly builds the program
	- Update Configuration files for Travis
	- Procedure to commit for Signature to be verified
		- git commit -S -m '<message to be added>' #(note -S is what signs, -s will not sign)
